## 2026-03-15 - Redundant heap allocations during LRU promotion in TTL Caching
**Learning:** Found an anti-pattern in the caching layer (`src/concourse/cache.rs`) where TTL entries promoted to LRU cache were unnecessarily re-serializing data via `bincode::serialize` that was already serialized in `entry.value`.
**Action:** Always reuse the existing serialized byte vectors (`entry.value.clone()`) and transfer ownership of strings (`cache_key`) directly when performing caching promotions across layers to avoid triggering new heap allocations.

## 2026-03-24 - Tensor Batch Retrieval Optimization
**Learning:** In `candle_core`, looping with `Tensor::get().unsqueeze()` and `Tensor::cat()` for batch row retrieval causes significant performance degradation due to intermediate allocations and host-device syncs.
**Action:** Always prefer `Tensor::index_select` with a 1D index tensor (converted to `u32` via `Tensor::from_vec(indices, (len,), device)`) for optimal batch row retrieval.

## 2026-03-24 - Vectorized Batch Gradients
**Learning:** In `src/gpu.rs` `CpuBackend::batch_field_gradient`, mapping `probe_gradient` over positions via `get()`, `unsqueeze(0)`, and `Tensor::cat` causes severe CPU bottlenecking due to N individual allocations and synchronizations.
**Action:** Always prefer vectorized broadcast math (e.g., `unsqueeze(1)` and `broadcast_sub/mul`) over looping `unsqueeze` and `cat` for O(1) device dispatches.

## 2026-04-24 - Tensor Operations Optimization for Negligible Forces
**Learning:** In `src/memory.rs`, iterating over splats and applying tensor operations (`diff.affine()`, `&total_force + &signed_force`) even when the scalar weight/scale is practically zero (e.g., `< 1e-7`) causes unnecessary CPU/GPU overhead. Small optimizations within the main generation loop significantly impact performance because these loops run thousands of times.
**Action:** When calculating weighted sums of tensors across a set of points (like splats), add an early continuation check (`if weight.abs() < 1e-7 { continue; }`) to skip expensive tensor allocations and additions when the contribution is negligible.
