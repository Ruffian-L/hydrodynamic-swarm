## 2024-05-24 - Path Traversal in Log Filename
**Vulnerability:** The CLI tool `crucible.rs` takes a user-provided `tokens` argument and interpolates it directly into a file path (`logs/crucible_{}t.txt`) which is then passed to `File::create`. This allows an attacker to perform path traversal attacks using `../` to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem.
**Learning:** Even internal or development-focused utilities need input validation when user input is used in file system operations. Relying on the assumption that an argument meant to represent a number will only contain numbers is unsafe.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly validate and sanitize input before using it in file paths. For numeric arguments, enforcing strict checks like `!s.is_empty() && s.chars().all(|c| c.is_ascii_digit())` ensures the value cannot contain path separators or traversal sequences.
## 2024-05-24 - SystemTime Clock Drift Panic
**Vulnerability:** SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap() will panic and crash the application if the system clock drifts or is misconfigured to a time before January 1, 1970. This creates a reliability and potential Denial of Service (DoS) issue.
**Learning:** Never assume the system clock is perfectly synced or monotonically increasing relative to the Unix Epoch when calculating timestamps, especially in logging or utility code that runs frequently.
**Prevention:** Use `.duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap_or_default()` instead of `.unwrap()` to gracefully handle `SystemTimeError` by returning a zero duration, preventing application crashes.
## 2024-05-24 - Missing Timeout on External API Call
**Vulnerability:** The HTTP client in `GrokOracle` was initialized without a timeout, making it vulnerable to infinite hangs if the external API is unresponsive, leading to resource exhaustion (DoS).
**Learning:** Always configure reasonable timeouts for network requests, especially to third-party APIs, to ensure the system remains responsive and does not leak resources or hang indefinitely.
**Prevention:** Use `.timeout(std::time::Duration::from_secs(X))` when building `reqwest::Client` configurations.
## 2026-05-26 - Fix TOCTOU file overwrite and relative path hijacking risks
**Vulnerability:** Found Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) risks via `File::create` causing potential symlink file overwrite, and relative path hijacking vulnerability when specifying target binaries.
**Learning:** In Rust environments, using standard file creation or loosely bound relative paths can expose local execution flow and configurations to exploitation if user environments define malicious paths.
**Prevention:** Strictly enforce using `OpenOptions::new().write(true).create_new(true)` with explicit `remove_file` prior to creation for safety. Additionally, safely resolve internal target binaries absolutely using `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`.
